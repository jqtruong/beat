  recording's volume is a bit low
  #+begin_src sh
    $ pacmd list-sources | grep -e 'index:' -e 'name:' -e device.description -e volume
        index: 0
      name: <alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor>
      volume: front-left: 33126 /  51% / -17.78 dB,   front-right: 33126 /  51% / -17.78 dB
      base volume: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB
      volume steps: 65537
        device.description = "Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"
      ,* index: 1
      name: <alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo>
      volume: front-left: 31471 /  48% / -19.11 dB,   front-right: 31471 /  48% / -19.11 dB
      base volume: 6554 /  10% / -60.00 dB
      volume steps: 65537
        device.description = "Built-in Audio Analog Stereo"
  #+end_src

  to boost the mic volume, first find the index for the
  monitor, which is 0, then set to a value between 0 and
  65536; eg. 50% is (/ 65536 2)

  #+begin_src sh
    pacmd set-source-volume 0 65536
  #+end_src

  now record from monitor is audible... \o/

   the built-in audio analog stereo is the source to use,
   but it worked from the monitor before... oh i'm dumb. the
   mic is fine as the source, but i need to record what i'm
   hearing!!! i should have named the files better!

** TODO beat this
   i think i stepped in something
   [cuz] it smells like shit
   might be something else that
   isn't not shit

** TODO piano loops
   see [[*play loop][play loop]]

* [2018-09-23 Sun]

** DONE record into loop
   multiple sound waves at different times.

   [[file:rec][rec]]: =./rec [OUTPUT_FILE (file path) [DURATION (seconds)]=

*** ui would be nice
    but later

** TODO play loop
   bash script to play with given parameters
   
   .o0(11 is 3... bytes!)
   .o0(there is not a null character in =eshell/echo=)
